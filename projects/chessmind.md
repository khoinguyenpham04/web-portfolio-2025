## Key Features Implementation

### Real-Time Move Analysis
```typescript
// AI-powered move evaluation
const analyzeMove = async (fen: string, move: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/analyze', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ fen, move })
  });
  
  const analysis = await response.json();
  return {
    evaluation: analysis.evaluation,
    explanation: analysis.explanation,
    suggestions: analysis.alternatives
  };
};
```

### Adaptive Difficulty System
```typescript
// Dynamic skill level adjustment
const adjustDifficulty = (playerRating: number, gameHistory: Game[]) => {
  const recentPerformance = calculatePerformance(gameHistory.slice(-10));
  const targetWinRate = 0.55; // Slight challenge for improvement
  
  if (recentPerformance.winRate > targetWinRate + 0.1) {
    return increaseDifficulty(playerRating);
  } else if (recentPerformance.winRate < targetWinRate - 0.1) {
    return decreaseDifficulty(playerRating);
  }
  
  return playerRating;
};
```

### Text-to-Speech Integration
```typescript
// Immersive audio feedback
const speakAnalysis = async (text: string) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/tts', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ text, voice: 'alloy' })
  });
  
  const audioBlob = await response.blob();
  const audio = new Audio(URL.createObjectURL(audioBlob));
  audio.play();
};
```
