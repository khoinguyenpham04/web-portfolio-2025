# YourWalk: AR Safety Navigation

## Overview

Won **1st Place** in the Snap Inc. Challenge at Junction, Europe's largest hackathon with 1,500+ participants. Built in 48 hours in Helsinki, Finland.

## The Problem

Walking alone at night can be stressful. Traditional navigation apps provide directions but lack awareness of safety conditions like crime rates, lighting, and pedestrian activity.

## What YourWalk Does

YourWalk pairs with Snap Spectacles to guide users with awareness rather than just directions.

### AR Guidance

Visualizes safe zones and risk levels directly through the Spectacles lenses. Users see real-time safety information overlaid on their environment.

### Agentic AI Companion

If the user feels unsafe, an AI agent initiates a conversation to keep them engaged and deter unwanted attention. The companion provides both practical support and a sense of presence.

### Intelligent Routing

Calculates risk scores within 200m using data on:

- Local crime statistics
- Lighting levels
- Pedestrian activity

Routes are optimized for safety rather than just speed or distance.

## Technical Implementation

- **Snap Spectacles** and **Lens Studio** for AR visualization
- Custom risk scoring algorithm combining multiple data sources
- Real-time route calculation with safety weighting
- Conversational AI agent for companion functionality

## Impact

Demonstrates how AR can solve real-world safety problems by providing contextual awareness that traditional apps cannot offer. The combination of visual guidance and AI companionship addresses both practical navigation and psychological comfort.
