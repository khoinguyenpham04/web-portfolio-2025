const runMonteCarloSimulation = (strategy: Strategy, iterations: number = 1000) => {
  const outcomes = [];
  
  for (let i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
    const marketScenario = generateRandomMarketConditions();
    const portfolioReturn = calculatePortfolioReturn(strategy, marketScenario);
    outcomes.push(portfolioReturn);
  }
  
  return {
    expectedReturn: calculateMean(outcomes),
    standardDeviation: calculateStdDev(outcomes),
    valueAtRisk: calculateVaR(outcomes, 0.05),
