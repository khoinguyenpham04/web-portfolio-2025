# Memoral: Agentic AI for Dementia Care

## Overview

Built in 24 hours at GreatUniHack 2025. Won three awards:

- **1st Place** in the Reply Challenge: Best Use of AI Agents in Healthcare
- **3rd Overall** out of 200+ participants
- **Hackathons UK Challenge Winner** for Best Use of AI Agents on ARM

## What Memoral Does

Memoral supports people living with dementia and Alzheimer's through:

- Conversational engagement
- Adaptive reminders
- Intelligent task management

It improves daily structure, promotes cognitive engagement, and reduces caregiver burden without intrusive sensors or complex hardware.

**For patients**: Consistency and connection through a familiar AI companion.

**For caregivers**: Real-time visibility into well-being and daily routines.

## Technical Implementation

### Multi-Agent Architecture

Built a multi-agent system with specialized agents for:

- **Memory Agent**: Manages patient context and conversation history
- **Task Agent**: Handles reminders and daily scheduling
- **Health Agent**: Monitors behavioral patterns and well-being indicators
- **Supervisor Agent**: Coordinates agent interactions and escalations

### Agent Orchestration

Used **LangGraph** for agent orchestration with a centralized contextual memory layer. This allows agents to share state and make coordinated decisions based on patient needs.

### Frontend

- **Next.js** and **TypeScript** for the application framework
- **TailwindCSS** and **Radix UI** for styling and accessible components
- Real-time caregiver dashboard for behavioral insights and routine tracking

## Impact

Demonstrates how agentic AI systems can deliver practical support in healthcare contexts. The multi-agent approach allows for specialized handling of different care aspects while maintaining a unified patient experience.
